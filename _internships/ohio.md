## Overview
The goal of this REU site program is to provide undergraduate students (psychology, social work, biology, pre-med, education) with an in-depth, hands-on experience focused on gaining clinical research skills for children with social, emotional and behavioral problems (SEB).
Students are trained in the application of the scientific method to develop hypotheses, and trained on how to design and conduct research studies on treatment-related issues for children with SEB. Students are also trained in the ethical conduct of research.
